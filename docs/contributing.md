# Contributing & Conventions

- **Code style**: Prettier enforced. Run `pnpm prettier:fix` before committing.
- **Types**: Keep types in `src/shared` where they are reused across bundles.
- **Components**: Prefer small Solid components with clear props. Co-locate styles and logic.
- **State editing UX**: Validate inputs where possible; surface errors inline.
- **Commits/PRs**: Small, focused commits; describe user-visible changes in the PR body.

## Repo Hygiene
- Avoid committing `dist/` (generated by build). 
- Keep test fixtures and utilities within `tests/`.
